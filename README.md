# Gatsby by sample

Learn Gatsby by sample, each of the samples contains a `readme.md` file that indicates the purpose of the sample plus an step by step guide to reproduce it.

### 00 Start

Usually, we are going to start with Gatsby installing the `gatsby-cli` to create initial project with some [Gatsby starter](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/starters/). But this sample is the starter sample for next one.

### 00 Implementation

In this sample we are going to start working with Gatsby pages, React components, images, Graphql, dynamic pages and connect it with Contentful.
